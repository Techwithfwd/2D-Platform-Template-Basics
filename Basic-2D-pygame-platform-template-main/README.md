# Basic-2D-pygame-platform-template
Includes comments for explanations 


This is just the basic structure for a platform game with moving sprite.

1. I decided to draw my platform layout in settings.py and use this to the draw() it into my game.

2. I incuded brief tags to help you understand

3. Any method you are unsure of please read the pygame docs on pygame.com or read the book I sent to you.
